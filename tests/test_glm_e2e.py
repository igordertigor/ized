# Test that qr docomposition gives the same results on chunks and in full go
# Test that more data converge to ground truth
# Test that increasing ridge penalty increases training error and decreases parameter vector
# Irrespective of basis, we should be able to approximate an arbitrary smooth function more accurately
# constraints?
# with multiple penalties, make sure that the gcv for the final penalty is better than a coarse grid search
# test a normal glm
# test a binomial logistic glm
# test a poisson log glm
